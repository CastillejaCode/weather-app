## Learning Goals
* Fetching information from APIs
* Async functions
* Tailwind CSS via webpack using PostCSS

## Features
* Current Temperature w/ daily max and min temp
* Conditions for current location
* Secondary weather information
* 3 Day forecast
* Save past location to local storage

## How to Use
* Just enter your city, state, and country by clicking on the search button 
  * If only entering city, state will default to California, and country will default to US
  * Country must be a 2 or 3 letter country code
  
## What to do in the future
* Figure out how to use favicons with webpack
* Change background based on current condition/ time of day
